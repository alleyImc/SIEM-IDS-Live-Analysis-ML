# Observation and Analysis of GoldenEye Attack

This section documents the monitoring and analysis of the GoldenEye DoS attack using Wazuh and Suricata. The focus is on the system metrics dashboards and Suricata alerts as visualized through the Wazuh Discover module.

## Analysis

- **CPU Usage - Line Chart (Top Left Panel):**  
  This component presents average CPU usage as a time series.
  From **21:40 onwards**, when the attack began, a noticeable increase in CPU utilization is observed.
  Around **21:45**, CPU usage exceeded **60%**, which reflects Suricata IDS attempting to analyze the high-volume HTTP traffic generated by the Kali Linux DoS attack.
  Although CPU usage dropped slightly in the following minutes, the systemâ€™s immediate reaction to the attack is clearly visible.

- **Memory Usage - Line Chart (Bottom Left Panel):**  
  This chart shows system memory utilization.
  From **21:40 onwards**, memory consumption gradually increased, surpassing **45%** during the attack.
  This indicates that the IDS engine required additional temporary memory to process the incoming flood of packets.

- **Disk Usage - Line Chart (Top Right Panel):**  
  The disk usage remained stable over time. 
  This demonstrates that the attack mainly stressed the CPU and memory resources, while disk I/O was not significantly affected.

- **System Load Average - Line Chart (Bottom Right Panel):**  
  This panel shows system load averages for **1, 5, and 15 minutes**.
  A sharp spike is observed in the **1-minute average**, reaching nearly **10** around 21:45, confirming that the system was under heavy processing load during the attack.
  The **5- and 15-minute averages** indicate that the system gradually returned to normal after the attack.

 These observations confirm that while GoldenEye primarily impacts CPU and RAM resources during the DoS attack, Suricata IDS successfully detected the abnormal traffic, and Wazuh dashboards provided clear visibility into both security events and system performance metrics.
